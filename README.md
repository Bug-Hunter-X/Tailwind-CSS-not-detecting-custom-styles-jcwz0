# Tailwind CSS - Styles Not Detected

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being picked up despite seemingly correct configuration. The problem arises from the `content` option in the Tailwind configuration file, which specifies the files Tailwind should scan for custom styles.

## Problem

The `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` is set to include `'./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'`, indicating Tailwind should scan all `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, and `.tsx` files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories.  However, Tailwind might fail to detect the custom styles in these files, resulting in no styles being applied.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the file paths in `content` are correctly specified and that the paths are accessible to your Tailwind configuration process. You may also need to restart your development server or rebuild the project.
